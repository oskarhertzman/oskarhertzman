### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In lines of code, a canvas unfolds,
Frontend whispers, stories told.
HTML structures, a foundation laid,
CSS styles, in colors arrayed.

JavaScript dances, dynamic and free,
Interactivity, a symphony.
Pixels align, responsive design,
A web of art, in browsers shine.

Through divs and spans, a tale unfolds,
Frontend magic, where beauty molds.
With each click and hover's grace,
A user's journey, a digital embrace.
